# Tableau_Project---Analysing_Growth_of_T-Series_Channel
In this project, I am going to analyse the top Youtube channel 'T-Series' using Tableau and pandas. Firstly, I cleaned this raw dataset, performed some operations to make it more convenient to use and easy to analyse on Tableau. Then I analysed different relationships among time, subscribers, views, likes, comments, and dislikes through Tableau Graphs. Then I made interactive Growth Dashboard which contains four graphs that tells us about the yearly, monthly growth of the channel as well the relationship between likes and dislikes and top years as per the variables. Then I made one story that tells us about the growth of channel in 2020 and the impact of covid-19 on channel's growth.
