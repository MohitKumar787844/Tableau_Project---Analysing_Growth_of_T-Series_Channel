# Tableau_Project-Analysed_Growth_of_T-Series_Channel

In this project, I analyzed the top Youtube channel 'T-Series' using Tableau and Pandas. First, I cleaned this raw dataset, performed some operations to make it more convenient to use and easier to analyze on Tableau. Then I analyzed the various relationships between time, customers, views, likes, comments and dislikes through tableau graphs. Then I created the interactive growth dashboard that has four graphs that tell us about the channel's annual, monthly growth as well as the relationship between likes and dislikes and the top years by variable. After that I made a story which tells us about the growth of the channel in 2020 and the impact of COVID-19 on the growth of the channel.
